📌 IoT Project Components & Functions (with JXBS-3001-NPK-RS)
1. Soil NPK Sensor (JXBS-3001-NPK-RS)

Role: Core sensing device.

Function: Measures the nutrient content of soil:

N (Nitrogen) → plant growth & leaf development.

P (Phosphorus) → root development, flowering.

K (Potassium) → disease resistance, fruit quality.

Interface: RS485 (Modbus RTU).

Output: Digital values (mg/kg).

Why RS485?

Long distance communication (up to 1200m).

High noise immunity (good for outdoor farms).

2. RS485 to TTL Converter

Role: Communication bridge.

Function:

Converts sensor’s RS485 differential signals (A, B) → TTL serial (TX, RX).

Lets microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi) read sensor data.

Example Modules: MAX485, SP3485.

3. Microcontroller / Processor

Choose depending on project needs:

🔹 Option A: Arduino Uno / Mega

Function: Reads sensor values via RS485 and sends them to serial monitor or GSM/WiFi module.

Good for: Simple, local monitoring.

🔹 Option B: ESP32 / NodeMCU

Function: Reads NPK data and uploads directly to the cloud via WiFi (MQTT/HTTP).

Good for: IoT dashboards, real-time monitoring.

🔹 Option C: Raspberry Pi

Function: Runs Python scripts, stores data in a local database, or uploads to cloud.

Good for: More advanced projects (data logging, AI analysis, dashboards).

4. Power Supply Module

Function: Provides stable 12V for sensor and 5V/3.3V for controller.

Options:

12V adapter (lab use).

Battery + DC-DC buck converter (field use).

Solar panel + charge controller + Li-ion battery (remote farm IoT).

5. IoT Communication Module

(If microcontroller doesn’t have WiFi/LTE built-in)

ESP8266 / ESP32 → WiFi upload.

SIM800L / SIM900 GSM Module → 2G/4G upload (SMS/MQTT).

LoRa Module (SX1278) → Long-range wireless, farm-to-gateway.

6. Cloud Platform (Software Module)

Function: Stores and visualizes data online.

Choices:

ThingSpeak → free, simple graph plotting.

ThingsBoard → professional dashboards, alerts.

Node-RED + InfluxDB + Grafana → self-hosted, customizable.

7. Dashboard / Mobile App

Function: End-user interface to see NPK levels.

Use case:

Display real-time soil NPK values.

Set alerts (e.g., low Nitrogen → SMS “Add Urea fertilizer”).

Graph trends for farm management.

8. Optional Add-On Sensors

(You can integrate with NPK sensor for a complete soil health module)

Soil Moisture Sensor → Water levels.

Soil pH Sensor → Acidity / alkalinity.

Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT22, SHT31) → Environment tracking.

📌 Data Flow (Module-Wise Function)

Soil → Sensor (JXBS-3001-NPK-RS) → detects NPK values.

RS485 → TTL Converter → translates signals.

Microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino/RPi) → reads digital values.

IoT Communication Module (WiFi/GSM/LoRa) → sends data to the cloud.

Cloud Platform → stores & analyzes soil data.

Dashboard/Mobile App → shows results to farmer/user.
